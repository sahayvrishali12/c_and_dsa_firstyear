# C Programming and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my learning journey and code implementations for C programming fundamentals and essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It's intended as a resource for anyone learning these topics, offering practical examples and explanations.

## Overview

This repository is organized into two main sections:

*   **C Programming:**  Covers fundamental concepts of C programming, from basic syntax and data types to more advanced topics like pointers, memory management, and file handling.
*   **DSA:** Focuses on the implementation of various data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, graph traversal) using the C programming language.
